# Next.js Static Rendering and Suspense Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to address Next.js static rendering errors and suspense boundary warnings.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dynamic Server Usage Error**  
   Routes that use `cookies()` from `next/headers` were failing during static rendering with this error:

   ```
   Route /api/auth/me couldn't be rendered statically because it used `cookies`
   ```

2. **Missing Suspense Boundary Error**  
   Pages using `useSearchParams()` were missing suspense boundaries:
   ```
   useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary
   ```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Route Handlers

All API routes that use `cookies()` now include the following export:

```javascript
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
```

This tells Next.js to render these routes dynamically, not statically.

### 2. Suspense Boundaries

Client components using `useSearchParams()` have been refactored to:

1. Extract the component content to a separate component function
2. Wrap it with `<Suspense>` in the default export function

Example:

```jsx
function PageContent() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  // ...component code
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <PageContent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Helper Scripts

Two utility scripts have been added to help identify and fix these issues:

### Fix Dynamic Routes

Automatically adds the `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` export to all route handlers that use cookies:

```bash
npm run fix:dynamic-routes
```

### Check for Missing Suspense Boundaries

Scans the project for pages using `useSearchParams()` without a Suspense boundary:

```bash
npm run check:suspense
```

## Manual Fixes

If you add new API routes that use cookies, either:

1. Run the `fix:dynamic-routes` script, or
2. Manually add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to the top of the file

If you add new pages that use `useSearchParams()`, make sure to wrap them in a Suspense boundary.
